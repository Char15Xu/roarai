### Configure SQLite Support

1. Download the appropriate `vector0.dylib` and `vss0.dylib` for your machine's hardware from https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vss/releases. Place `vector0.dylib` and `vss0.dylib` files into the `rag/file_conversion_router/embedding/dist/debug` directory.

2. Ensure that `DIRECTORY_PATH` points to the correct directory containing the necessary pickle file.

3. Running `python rag/file_conversion_router/embedding/table_create.py` will create `embeddings.db` and `[picklefile_name].db` under the current running directory.
